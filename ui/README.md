# Client Management - Frontend (Angular 17 standalone)

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Run development server:
   ```
   npx ng serve --open
   ```

3. The app expects an API at http://localhost:3000/api by default.
   You can run the provided Express API in the other scaffold or change the base URL in the services.

Notes:
- This is a lightweight scaffold using standalone components (no NgModule).
- If the Angular CLI is not installed globally, use `npx ng serve`.
